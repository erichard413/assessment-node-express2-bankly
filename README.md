# assessment-node-express2-bankly

In this assessment I was given a working app for a financial banking system, Bankly. However there were several bugs in the application. Even though unit tests were all passing, there were some crucial security bugs to find and correct. Bugs are outlined in the bugs.md file. Fixes for the bugs are marked in code with "FIXES BUG#x", and tests to test the bug has been fixed are marked "TESTS BUG#x".
